## 🚨 The Problem

AI agents are getting powerful. They can browse the web, execute code, access your files. And we're all plugging in random "skills" and MCP servers without knowing what they actually do.

We scanned **33,530 AI agent skills** from ClawHub, SkillsMP, and MCP Market.

**The result:** 12% contain critical security issues:
- 🔑 Credential stealers
- 🐚 Reverse shells  
- 💉 Prompt injection attacks
- 📤 Data exfiltration

## ✅ The Solution

SkillShield is the **first security-scored directory** for AI agent skills. Every extension gets:

- **0-100 Trust Score** — instantly see if a skill is safe
- **Detailed Risk Breakdown** — what vulnerabilities were found
- **Category Browsing** — 15 categories, from Development to Security
- **Full-Text Search** — find skills by name, author, or description
- **Free CLI Scanner** — audit skills locally before installing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Browse the Directory
👉 **[skillshield.dev](https://skillshield.dev)** — Pre-scanned database of 33,530+ skills

### Scan Locally
```bash
# Coming soon: CLI scanner
